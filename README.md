## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **PaweÅ‚**, aviation fan - currently working in Cold Flow Laboratory Polonia Aero (part of GE Aviation) where we design and test low pressure turbines for jest engines.

After work hours I like to code and learn new technologies. 
Currently studying **JavaScript** / **React** / TypeScript / Node.js in CodersLab.

Except for engineering and cooding I like to read about economics and investments (that's why Lite Funds)
When my eyes need some rest from a screen I go to yoga classes.

### Proud father of **Lite Funds** project available below:

âš¡ Fun fact about me: during my engineering studies I work as a Fashion Model which allowed me to live for couple months in Tokio, NYC, Seoul, Paris and Milan. Didn't enjoy photoshooting that much though...
